## Abstract
Measuring microbial growth in a mixed culture is laborious and expensive, especially in non-model organisms, as it requires unique genotypic or phenotypic markers. We have developed Curveball (http://curveball.yoavram.com), a new method for predicting growth in a mixed culture from growth curve data is using a well-known growth model and a newly derived competition model. We validated Curveball's predictions using growth curve and competition experiments with bacteria. Our method does not only result in a simpler and more cost-effective approach for predicting growth in a mixed culture and inferring relative fitness, but also provide information on the specific growth traits that contribute to differences in fitness. Therefore, our research contributes to the important integration between population dynamics and population genetics.
